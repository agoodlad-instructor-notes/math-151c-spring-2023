## M018 Basic Algebra for Finite Math Spring 2021 Lecture Notes

During the first spring 2021 eight week period, I was an assistant instructor for the Indiana University class Basic Algebra for Finite Math (M018). This class is a two credit prep course for Finite Math. In this class, we learn basic sets, basic counting, basic probability, algebra on linear equations, matrices, reduced row operations, inequalities, and linear programming.

My lecture notes for this class are more or less the same as my notes for when I taught the class during the previous semester during the Fall II period, so I refer you to the [Fall II notes](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m018-fall-ii-2020) for lectures there.

In addition to the lecture notes, I also wrote up the following guides on how to do certain problems that I gave to the students to supplement my class notes

**Linear Equations**
