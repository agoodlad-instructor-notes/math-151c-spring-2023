## Math-151C Basic Algebra Calculus I DePauw University Spring 2023 Lecture Notes

During spring 2023 spring semester, I'm currently teaching Caclulus I (Math-151C) as a part-time instructor at DePauw University. This class is a three credit class that teaches what you'd typically expect in a standard first semester of Calculus in college. In this class, we learn limits and continuity; the various definitions of a derivative; the power, product, quotient, and chain rule; implicit differentiation; related rates and optimization; the definition of integration; antiderivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus; and u-substitution.

My lecture notes for this class are divided by chapters on the book we use is the 4th edition of *Calculus by J. Rogawski, C. Adams, and R. Franzosa*, and note that this class is ongoing so only the notes for the first two Chapters have been completed, I have not started my Chapter 4 and 5 notes, yet, and the Chapter 3 notes are still in progress and I haven't published it, yet, as a PDF (though I have the math.ios file that I update live as the class goes on, which I'll use for reference until the Chapters gets done).

As of 4/3/2023, here are my lecture notes:

-[Chapter 1: Precalculus Review (1/31-2/7 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/math-151c-spring-2023/spring-2023-math-151C-chapter-1-lecture-notes.pdf)

-[Chapter 2: Limits (2/2-3/2 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/math-151c-spring-2023/spring-2023-math-151C-chapter-2-lecture-notes.pdf)

-[Chapter 3: Differentiation (3/2-ongoing lectures)](https://www.mathcha.io/editor/m7ZojhOwsvWhqp4Xx1f4wJEJwIWE95zmHqwYvp) (stay tuned for an update!) 

-Chapter 4: Applications of the Derivative (stay tuned!)

-Chapter 5: Integration (stay tuned!)
